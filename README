# Build

Make sure you have libgmp-dev (or equiv) installed, then:

$ make

You should check everything works:

$ make test
javah -jni gnu.java.math.GMP
java -Djava.library.path=. -Dgnu.native.debug=true Test
if you don't see "using pure java implementation", all is well

# TODO

debian build script that links against gcj-4.*-jre-lib
- this requires splitting java.diff/Makefile to build a BigInteger with only
  a package change (to gnu.java.math), minus all the other changes
